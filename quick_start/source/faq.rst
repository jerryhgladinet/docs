General

CentreStack is Gladinet's enterprise product. It was called Gladinet Cloud Enterprise in the past. With more and more enterprise companies using the product and shift the company focus into the enterprise solutions, the name CentreStack was chosen to represent the product instead of extending the name from Gladinet.

"CentreStack" packages all of the file sync and share access infrastructure into a package that an Enterprise/MSP can install on-premise, or inside a DMZ to have full control and security protection, with optional native Active Directory integration. You can set any storage (or your own file servers) as the default cloud storage and provide it to your customers.

What is the best way to try CentreStack features?
