Enable SSL – Install SSL Certificate
########################################

.. note::

    Assuming that you have already setup your DNS to point to a DNS name connected to the CentreStack server and an SSL certificate already purchased for the DNS name. If not, you can acquire an SSL certificate from your SSL vendor.
    
    We recommend using https://www.ssllabs.com/ to test your SSL setup because 
    the SSL Labs site will produce a report on whether the SSL is compatible with all 
    devices such as iOS devices.
    
    You can also use openssl to check the SSL certificates and whether or not the whole certificate
    trust chain is completely installed on the server side.
    
    .. code::
    
        openssl s_client -connect server.yourwebhoster.com:443
    
You will install the SSL certificate by using the IIS Manager. Look for "Server Certificates" and double click on it.

Click on "Import" to import an existing SSL Certificate. Leave the Certificate Store as "Personal" or "Web Hosting", either
way is fine.

Verify that the certificate is available:

You can also verify the SSL certificate from the MMC/Certificates snap-in (Local Computer).

Now you can bind the "Default Web Site" to the SSL certificate for HTTPS. Right click on the "Default Web Site"
and select “Edit Binding”.
