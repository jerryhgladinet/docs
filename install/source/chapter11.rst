When you are ready to license CentreStack, 
the easiest way to do this is to use the "purchase now" link 
from the cluster manager web portal under the self-hosted licenses view.

The link will take you to your CentreStack
Partner Portal account and from there, you can 
acquire licenses and give them out to your clusters.
