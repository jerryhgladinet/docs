9 Add additional |prodname| servers to the cluster
###################################################
Adding an additional |prodname| server is as simple as installing the first CentreStack server. Run the |prodname| server installation program on another server, specifying the same database as the first server in the cluster.

.. warning::
    Adding additional |prodname| servers to an existing cluster is optional. 

    If you only have a few hundred users, you don't need to have a 
    second node from a scalability perspective. The scalability
    point of adding a second CentreStack Server is at 1000 users. 
    For best practices, you will
    always scale vertically first such as making a 2-CPU machine into a
    4-CPU machine and add RAM to the |prodname| Server before
    scaling horizontally by adding more |prodname| Servers.
    
    However, from a high availability(HA) perspective, you may want to 
    have a second |prodname| Server.

.. warning::    
    An external database server should be deployed if you are scaling out the cluster to more than one |prodname| server. The "all-in-one" deployment with a local MySQL database is not intended to be used for scaling out or high availability.

.. warning::    
    A hardware or software load balancer will be required if more than one |prodname| server is deployed in a cluster.

.. warning::
    All |prodname| servers in the same cluster must use the same time zone.
