.. important::
        Sharing with an email user creates a **Guest User**. Each licensed user can create 3 guest user accounts. If there are 3 licensed users, then a total of 9 guest users can be added for that tenant. If the number of guest users has reached the limit, and the tenant is set up to auto grow the number of licensed users, then one more license will be added to the tenant. 


Share Via
------------------------

User can share the file with a third-party application such as Gmail or WhatsApp.
