Conclusion
===============

Gladinet’s vision is to enable access to enterprise data from anywhere using any device including mobile devices like Android, iPhones, and iPads. The Android CentreStack application is feature-rich which allows enterprise users to not only access the data but also sync and collaborate on that data. Users can access, share, edit, and perform other functions on the data when accessing from Android devices just like they do when they access it from Windows or MAC clients.
