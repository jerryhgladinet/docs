CentreStack Android Client User Guide
****************************************

Introduction
================

Welcome to the CentreStack Android Client User Guide. This guide describes the Android client application for CentreStack, the managed file synchronization, and sharing solution.

Users can access CentreStack cloud files using any device of their choice as CentreStack has clients for Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows 8+, and more. We have created a native Android application that you can download from the Google Play Store. This provides access to files and folders in your CentreStack account.

There is also a white-labeled CentreStack Android app called "Cloud Android Client" by Gladinet that can be distributed by service providers and enterprises to their users.

If you have the fully branded CentreStack Android client, the look and feel of the app may be different but the functionality is the same. You can obtain a fully branded CentreStack Android Client with your company name and product logo from http://www.centrestack.com (partner portal).

Preview
----------

Tap a folder to enter it for browsing, and tap a file to open it in a file previewer. From within the previewer, you have a 3-dot menu on the lower-right side, that allows you to perform other actions on the file. 

**(1) Download** allows you to copy the file to your downloads folder on the device.

**(2) Delete** lets you delete the file from the folder if you have permissions to do so. 

**(3) Share** lets you send access information to anyone with an email address. 

**(4) Get public link** gives you a url that you can share with anyone that needs read-only access to the file. 

**(5) Rename** lets you rename the file if you have permission to do so. 

**(6) Share manager** gives you access to any shares that exist for the file, where you can modify the share or delete it. 

**(7) Word Icon** this is the mobile Microsoft Word application icon. This icon will be different depending on the file you are previewing (e.g., if it was an Excel file, the icon would be an Excel icon). If you click the icon, the file will open in that application.

Sharing Options
================

You can select the files or folders that you want to share from your Android devices. 

Sharing a File
----------------

From the file view you can long-press an item and a context menu will appear. In this context menu you can "Share" in several ways: "Share", "Get public link", "Share manager". 

If you press **"Share" (1)**, you will be taken to the "Share/Invite User to share" screen. There you can add user emails and select various options for sharing. 

If you press **"Get public link" (2)**, a URL will be provided that you can use to paste into an email or other field to share public read-only access to the file. 

If you press **"Share manager" (3)**, you will be taken to a view of all previous shares for this file. You can add new shares there or delete previous shares to revoke access.  

.. image:: _static/image_09_1.png 

.. important::
        Sharing with an email user creates a **Guest User**. Each licensed user can create 3 guest user accounts. If there are 3 licensed users, then a total of 9 guest users can be added for that tenant. If the number of guest users has reached the limit, and the tenant is set up to auto grow the number of licensed users, then one more license will be added to the tenant. 


If you choose the **"Share" (1)** option (see above), in the next screen, enter the email(s) of any users you want to add. Press the **">"** icon to add users to the share. 

.. image:: _static/image_09_2.png

In the next screen, you can click the yellow arrow to **"Continue as it is now"** (read-only access). Or choose **"Add user as a Guest User"** to get access to other settings.

If you chose the default option, the user(s) you added will receive an email giving access to the shared item. 


Sharing/Protection Options

If you click the Share Menu button on the bottom-right of the screen you get other options. **Add more users** to the share list, **copy public (read-only) link** to the clipboard, **refresh the list**.

Conclusion
===============

Gladinet’s vision is to enable access to enterprise data from anywhere using any device including mobile devices like Android, iPhones, and iPads. The Android CentreStack application is feature-rich which allows enterprise users to not only access the data but also sync and collaborate on that data. Users can access, share, edit, and perform other functions on the data when accessing from Android devices just like they do when they access it from Windows or MAC clients.
