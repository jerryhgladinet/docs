****************************************

Introduction
================

Welcome to the CentreStack IOS Client User Guide. This guide describes the Android client application for CentreStack, the managed file synchronization, and sharing solution.

Users can access CentreStack cloud files using any device of their choice as CentreStack has clients for Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows 8+, and more. We have created a native Android application that you can download from the Google Play Store. This provides access to files and folders in your CentreStack account.

The white-labeled CentreStack Android app called “Cloud Android Client” by Gladinet that can be distributed by service providers and enterprises to their users. 

If you have the fully branded CentreStack Android client, the look and feel of the app may be different but the functionality is the same. You can obtain a fully branded CentreStack IOS Client with your company name and product logo from http://www.centrestack.com (partner portal).

Sharing a File

If you press **"Share Manager" (1)**, you will be taken to the "Share/Invite User to share" screen. There you can add user emails and select various options for sharing including getting a public link.

.. important::
        Sharing with an email user creates a **Guest User**. Each licensed user can create 3 guest user accounts. If there are 3 licensed users, then a total of 9 guest users can be added for that tenant. If the number of guest users has reached the limit, and the tenant is set up to auto grow the number of licensed users, then one more license will be added to the tenant. 


If you choose the **"Share Manager" (1)** option (see above), in the next screen, enter the email(s) of any users you want to add. Press the **">"** icon to add users to the share.

Conclusion
===============

Gladinet’s vision is to enable access to enterprise data from anywhere using any device including mobile devices like Android, iPhones, and iPads. The IOS CentreStack application is feature-rich which allows enterprise users to not only access the data but also sync and collaborate on that data. Users can access, share, edit, and perform other functions on the data when accessing from IOS devices just like they do when they access it from Windows or MAC clients.
