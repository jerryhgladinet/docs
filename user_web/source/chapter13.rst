Sharing vs. Publishing
=======================

There are two ways to share files and folders in |prodname|  – publishing and sharing.

*  **Publishing:** 
 
    Only available for the administrator who can share any tenant-wide folder. It will only work with team-users in a specific |prodname| account (tenant account). Publishing a team folder can’t go outside of the tenant scope.

*  **Sharing:** 
 
    Both the administrator and team-users can share files with anyone that has an email address. The recipient of the share will get an
    email with a link to open the folder or download the file. If the email recipient is also a |prodname| Cloud user, he/she can access the shared file or folder directly from |prodname|.

    Administrators can prevent team-users from sharing if needed.
