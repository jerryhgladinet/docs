Uploading Files
================

In |prodname|, you have different options to upload files and folders. You can upload one file at a time using the ‘Upload File’ option under Upload You can also upload folders using the ‘Upload Folder’ option under Upload. Last but not least you can also use ‘Upload Folders and Files’ to upload multiple files simultaneously, or drag & drop files from a local desktop to the |prodname| Cloud web portal to start the upload.

.. warning::

    Different upload methods may have different advantage and disadvantage on different web browsers and different web browser configuration, such as whether it is HTML5 enabled,
    Java enabled or Flash enabled.
    
    By default, only one upload method was exposed in the web user interface. However, the tenant administrator, based on the kind of web browser the company is using and the kind of
    configuration the web browser has, can decide which upload method to expose to the end user (Team User).
    
    Below is the Group Policy->Client Control->Web Portal setting administrator can control.
