After signup, the administrator will get a login to |prodname|. To setup a team environment, the administrator needs to add team users. Only the administrator or delegated administrators or users that has a user manager role assigned can add users.

To manage users, go to ‘Management Console’ under user on the top right:

Managing User Quotas
=====================

Administrators can assign a quota to each user. A user will not be allowed to upload files to |prodname| once their quota has been reached.

If the quota is 0 for the user, there is no limit on how much storage the user can use.

Click the ‘Management Console’ and select ‘User Manager’. Click the "Manage User" menu on a user to manage and select "Set Quota".

    RESET USER PASSWORD


After changing the login password, an email will be sent to notify the user of the change. Admins can choose to include the new password in the email, or exclude the new password from the email. If the password is not included, the admin will need to convey the new password to the user in some other way.

    PASSWORD OPTIONS


When either the email or password is changed, please update the corresponding login credentials in the |prodname| Cloud Desktop or Cloud Server.

.. warning::

    This only applies to a native |prodname| user. If you have Active Directory users, you will need to manage user's credential the Active Directory way.
