Sharing vs Access to File Server Shares
==========================================

After signup, the administrator will get a login to |prodname|. To setup a team environment, the administrator needs to add team users. Only the administrator or delegated administrators or users that has a user manager role assigned can add users.

To manage users, go to ‘Management Console’ under user on the top right:

    CREATING OR MIGRATING USERS




*  **File Server Shares Access:** 
 
    Only available for the administrator who can enable remote access to any existing file server shares or folders created in Triofox. An admin can give access to shares to
    native Triofox users or existing Active Directory users.  
 
*  **Sharing:** 
 
    Both the administrator and users can share files and folders with anyone that has an email address if IT allows it. The recipient of the share will get an
    email with a link to open the folder or download the file. If the email recipient is also a |prodname| Cloud user, he/she can access the shared file or folder directly 
    from the |prodname|.

    Administrators can prevent users from sharing if needed.

Deleting Users
===============

When a user leaves the team, administrators can delete the user’s login. Just click the Delete icon in ‘User Manager’ window.

File Sharing

    INVITE PEOPLE TO YOUR SHARE

On the second share window you have access to the share options panel where you can make important decisions such as how long you want the share to be active and 
how much control you want to give the user (e.g., read only, full control access). You can also make this share available to the public by getting a public link. Also, if desired,
you can subsribe to notifications for the share.

    SHARE OPTIONS PANEL

When either the email or password is changed, please update the corresponding login credentials in the |prodname| Cloud Desktop or Cloud Server.


    This only applies to a native |prodname| user. If you have Active Directory users, you will need to manage user's credential the Active Directory way.
