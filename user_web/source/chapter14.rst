Subscribing To Change Notifications For Team Folders
======================================================

Users can subscribe change notifications for Team Folders. Once subscribed, whenever a file or folder is changed in the team folder, the user will
get an email with a list of changes. This notification only applies when the change is done by other users. It will not send out the notification
email when the changes are done by the user himself/herself.

Visit the root of the team folder (1). On the right bottom of the window, click the "Show/Hide Info Panel" icon (2) and in the side panel select "I want to receive notification..." checkbox (3) to subscribe the change notification.
