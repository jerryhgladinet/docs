**Native User** 

    Native user refers to Triofox user that is not related
    to any Active Directory.
    
**Batch create users**

    These are native users in a comma separated file that can 
    be pasted into a text area so the users can be batch created.

    Active Directory means users from Local Area Network (LAN) 
    that is in the same network as the |prodname| server.

When a new user is created, the administrator can specify the amount of storage that the new user is allowed to use. The email address will send a welcome email to the 
new user and will serve as his/her username.
