Create Folders
===================

Folders Created in |prodname| are Versioned Folders.

|prodname| will maintain the version history of any files uploaded to versioned folders. From |prodname|, a user can download any previous versions of a file. From the |prodname| Desktop/Server Agent, a user can restore previous versions of files and recover deleted files.


To create a folder, go to the parent folder and click "New Folder" in the drop-down menu **(1)** or right click in the folder background and choose "New Folder" **(2)** from the context menu.

    ATTACHING A FOLDER

These folders are the local folders from the local PC/Mac that |prodname| users have attached to |prodname|. Once a local folder is attached, a user can immediately access it in |prodname|. |prodname| will maintain the version history of files in the attached local folder. The local folder is also being synchronized with |prodname| ("cloud side").

You can upload one file at a time using the ‘Upload File’ option under Upload You can also upload folders using the ‘Upload Folder’ option under Upload.

It is possible to upload multiple files at a time. This is supported on all browsers. The same is true for Upload Folder. To access these options you can click the "+" icon **(1)** or right click on the portal background **(2)** and select your upload option there.

    SELECTING FILES FOR UPLOAD


Upload Using Local Uploader
============================

(This is Windows only feature) When uploading big files and big folders, the “upload using local uploader” may be the best option for web browser based upload. If it is enabled by the Tenant Manager (deselected) **(1)** in the Group Policy Home > Web Portal settings. Clicking this option **(2)** will download a thin local uploader binary first and then the local uploader will do the upload. The local uploader has retry and other reliability measures to make sure the upload is successful. Basically it uses the web browser to download an executable, and the executable does the rest of the uploading work.
