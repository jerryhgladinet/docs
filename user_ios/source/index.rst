Getting Started

Welcome to the CentreStack IOS Client User Guide. This guide describes the Android client application for CentreStack, the managed file synchronization, and sharing solution.

Users can access CentreStack cloud files using any device of their choice as CentreStack has clients for Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows 8+, and more. We have created a native IOS application that you can download from the App Store. This provides access to files and folders in your CentreStack account.

If you have the fully branded CentreStack IOS client, the look and feel of the app may be different but the functionality is the same. You can obtain a fully branded CentreStack IOS Client with your company name and product logo from http://www.centrestack.com (partner portal).

        Sharing with an email user creates a **Guest User**. Each licensed user can create 3 guest user accounts. If there are 3 licensed users, then a total of 9 guest users can be added for that tenant. If the number of guest users has reached the limit, and the tenant is set up to auto grow the number of licensed users, then one more license will be added to the tenant. 


If you choose the **"Share Manager" (1)** option (see above), in the next screen, enter the email(s) of any users you want to add. Press the **">"** icon to add users to the share.
